SETUP:
1. Download vk_api, urllib libraries for python3.
2. Obtain user's personal token. 
3. Paste obtained token in 'token' variable of vk_api.VkApi() method.
4. Save and run the .py file. 
5. Input the ID of the user, whose photos you would like to download.
6. Wait until download is complete, either press Ctrl+C(Win OS)/Win+Z(Linux) to stop downloading.

IMPORTANT!
The token you get, it should have permission to view private messages.

VK recently uploaded info, which says it will be no longer avaliable to get tokens for private massages. So, maybe, this script might become
outdated, but I will keep an eye for that.
